# Snapvis

This is the root folder of the Snapvis project. It's separated into the [plugin](snapvis-plugin) and an [example project](calculator).

The motivation for building the example project is twofold: (1) it allowed me to get acquainted with Kotlin before diving into development of the IntelliJ plugin, and (2) I wanted to develop the plugin while having access to a non-trivial example project that I have full control over and knowledge of.

Please consult each project's own README for additional information.
